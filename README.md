# 📊 Risk Assessment and Analysis on IDS Logs

## 🎯 Objective
To collect data from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and perform comprehensive risk analysis in order to identify vulnerabilities, improve detection capabilities, and inform security decision-making.

## 🛠️ Methodology

This project used data from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dnkumars/cybersecurity-intrusion-detection-dataset ], applied a combination of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques to analyze IDS logs:

- ✅ **Sensitivity Analysis** – To determine how different variables affect the detection outcome.
- ⏳ **Survival Analysis** – To estimate the time until certain types of attacks are detected.
- 🧠 **Expert Judgment Integration** – Incorporated domain expertise to complement quantitative results.
- 🔄 **Decision Tree Analysis** – Evaluated multiple risk response options.
- ⚠️ **Fault Tree and Event Tree Analysis** – Modeled attack progression paths and failure points.

## 💡 Results

- 🔍 Gained insights into false positive patterns and detection gaps within the IDS.
- 📉 Formulated a **risk mitigation strategy** based on analyzed patterns and expert input.
- 🚀 Enhanced the **efficiency** of the IDS by reducing noise and improving response prioritization.

## ✅ Use Case

This project is ideal for:

- Cybersecurity students and professionals studying **risk analysis** and **IDS effectiveness**.
- Organizations aiming to evaluate and refine their **threat detection systems**.
- Anyone interested in applying **statistical models** to real-world cybersecurity data.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This analysis was performed in a controlled lab environment. Always ensure you have proper authorization before working with IDS logs in a production setting.
